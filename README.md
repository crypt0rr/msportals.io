# msportals.io - Microsoft Portals #

Microsoft has a **lot** of portals.

After not remembering all the Microsoft Portal URLs so many times, Adam decided to make a list and with a help from a few others, have gotten to this stage. You can read more about the details on the [About page](https://github.com/adamfowlerit/msportals.io/blob/master/about.md)
